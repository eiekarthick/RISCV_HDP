We can access compiler explorer using the link https://godbolt.org/


Compiler Explorer is a free, open-source website that allows developers to 
interactively analyze and compare code generated by different compilers. 
It helps in analyzing and comparing the assembly output generated by different compilers for the same code.
It helps in understanding the link between source code and assembly code
(hovering over the source code or assembly output highlights the corresponding element in the other window).
Supports a wide range of target architectures, including x86, arm, risc-v, and many more.
